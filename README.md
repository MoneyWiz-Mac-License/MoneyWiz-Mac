## Overview

<a href="#">MoneyWiz for macOS</a> focuses on keeping finances aligned across multiple devices and institutions. It connects to banks where possible and supports manual tracking where needed, combining everything into a single timeline of activity. Users can sort transactions into categories, budgets and groups that reflect their own mental model. This flexibility makes it easier to answer questions like “how much do we really spend eating out?” or “what is our monthly burn rate?” without complex exports.

Schedules and reminders help keep upcoming bills, transfers and subscriptions visible well before they are due. Sync engines and <a href="#">cross-platform support</a> mean changes on the Mac propagate to other devices, ensuring that on-the-go edits don’t create inconsistencies. Detailed charts and reports surface income versus expenses, category breakdowns and long-range projections. For households and freelancers alike, this builds a more grounded sense of financial health than single-account banking apps can provide.

On macOS, MoneyWiz feels at home running in the background, ready to reconcile, categorise or review whenever you have a few minutes. It pairs well with online banking portals, tax tools and document scanners. Over time, it becomes a trusted window into money flows, reducing anxiety by making the numbers visible and explorable instead of opaque.
